# M8650_delay_line_replacement

This is a delay line replacement for a Digital KL8E M8650 serial board.

The originals seem to be missing / broken off sometimes.

When you order the PCBs notify the manufacturer that the 
PCB had no silkscreen and no soldermask!
It is just a plain PCB with a HAL finish.
